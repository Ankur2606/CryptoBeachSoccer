## Gameplay Mechanics

### Basic Rules
- Matches last 3 minutes
- Player with most goals at the end wins
- If tied at the end of regulation time, the game ends in a draw

### Field Navigation
- The beach field has sandy terrain that affects ball physics
- Palm trees around the perimeter are solid obstacles
- Goals are positioned at both ends of the field

### Ball Control
- **Basic Movement**: Position your player near the ball to make contact
- **Ball Physics**: The ball obeys realistic gravity and momentum
- **Control Radius**: Each character has a default ball control radius (Bitcoin and PepeCoin have better radius)
- **Ball Reset**: Press R if the ball gets stuck or falls off the field

### Kicking Mechanics
- **Power**: Kick strength varies based on character abilities and power-ups
- **Direction**: The ball generally travels in the direction your character is facing
- **Aerial Kicks**: Jump before kicking for a higher trajectory
- **Projectile Motion**: Kicks follow realistic arcs based on power and angle

## Power-ups

Power-ups appear on the field as glowing cryptocurrency coins. These provide temporary ability boosts without using your character's special ability.

### Power-up Types
All power-ups correspond to the four character abilities:
- **Bitcoin Coin**: Increases kick power and ball control
- **Ethereum Coin**: Boosts jump height and speed
- **Dogecoin Coin**: Grants temporary invincibility and speed
- **PepeCoin Coin**: Enhances all character stats

### Power-up Mechanics
- Power-ups spawn randomly on the field every 15-30 seconds
- A maximum of 3 power-ups can exist on the field at once
- Collected power-ups activate immediately for their specified duration
- PepeCoin power-ups are rare (15% spawn chance) but offer the greatest benefits

## Tips & Strategies

### Offensive Strategies
1. **Power Shot**: Use Bitcoin's HODL ability for powerful shots from distance
2. **Aerial Attack**: With Ethereum's Smart Contract ability, perform high jumps to get over the opponent
3. **Speed Rush**: Utilize Dogecoin's To The Moon ability to quickly move the ball past defenders
4. **Combo Play**: Collect a power-up and immediately activate your ability for stacked effects

### Defensive Strategies
1. **Goal Blocking**: Position yourself between the opponent and your goal
2. **Interception**: Time your jumps to block incoming shots
3. **Ball Recovery**: Use speed boosts to quickly chase down loose balls
4. **Strategic Reset**: If the opponent is close to scoring, consider using the reset button (R) as a last resort

### Advanced Techniques
1. **Wall Bounce**: Use side boundaries to bounce the ball around defenders
2. **Corner Kick**: Position the ball near corners for angled shots that are harder to defend
3. **Jump Kick Combo**: Jump and kick simultaneously for aerial shots
4. **Power-up Denial**: Collect power-ups even when not needed to prevent opponent from using them

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Ball Stuck**: Press R to reset the ball to the center of the field
2. **Character Not Moving**: Ensure no keys are stuck and controls are properly configured
3. **Ability Not Activating**: Check the cooldown timer in the UI before attempting to use abilities
4. **Performance Issues**: 
   - Lower resolution in settings
   - Close other background applications
   - Ensure browser is updated to latest version

### Controls Not Working
1. Check if keyboard inputs are being registered by your browser
2. Ensure no browser extensions are interfering with key inputs
3. Try refreshing the page or restarting the game
