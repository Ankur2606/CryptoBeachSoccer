Prompt for AI Agent: Enhance "Crypto Beach Soccer"
Enhance the game "Crypto Beach Soccer" with the following improvements, ensuring compatibility with the existing structure and libraries (Three.js and Cannon.js):
1. Ball Physics and Bounding Boxes

Issue: The ball's bounding boxes are poorly defined, allowing it to travel to inaccessible positions, especially near the goal lines.
Solution: Make the ball's movement robust so it cannot travel beyond the sides of the goal line except through the goal net.
Use Cannon.js's collision filters to restrict the ball’s movement, allowing it to pass only through the goal net and not the sides.
Add invisible walls or planes around the field boundaries to keep the ball within the playable area.
Adjust the ball’s restitution (bounciness) and friction to prevent erratic behavior.



2. AI Opponent Movement

Issue: The AI opponent moves too slowly (e.g., pixel per second) and lacks responsiveness.
Solution: Make the AI quicker and more dynamic.
Increase the AI’s movement speed by multiplying its velocity vector or increasing the force applied to its movement.
Implement a simple state machine with states like "chase ball," "defend goal," and "attack" to enhance responsiveness and challenge.



3. Player Backward Movement Speed

Issue: The player’s backward movement (likely triggered by the "S" key) is too slow.
Solution: Increase the backward movement speed.
Adjust the speed variable or force applied when the backward key (e.g., "S") is pressed.
Ensure the increase maintains balance with forward movement for smooth gameplay.



4. Visual Enhancement: Coin on Player’s Head

Task: Load an image of a coin on top of the player’s head.
Solution:
Create a THREE.Mesh or sprite for the coin using a texture from an image file.
Position the coin relative to the player’s head using local transformations, ensuring it follows the player’s movements.



5. Crypto Memes and Puns

Task: Add humor with cryptocurrency and blockchain-related memes and puns.
Solution:
Use THREE.TextGeometry to display text overlays with puns like "HODL the ball!" or "To the moon!" during key events (e.g., scoring).
Add sound effects like "Wow!" or "Much score!" triggered by goals or actions.
Include visual gags, such as a "mining" animation (e.g., a pickaxe effect) when a player scores.



Testing

Test each enhancement individually to ensure functionality and seamless integration.
Verify that:
The ball stays within bounds and only enters the goal net.
The AI and player movements are noticeably quicker and responsive.
The coin appears correctly above the player’s head.
Memes and puns enhance the game’s humor without disrupting mechanics.



Ensure all changes are optimized for performance and do not introduce new bugs.
