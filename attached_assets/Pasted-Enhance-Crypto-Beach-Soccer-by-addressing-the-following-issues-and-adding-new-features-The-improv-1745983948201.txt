Enhance "Crypto Beach Soccer" by addressing the following issues and adding new features. The improvements focus on keeping the ball accessible, refining the kick mechanics for realism, and introducing random crypto-themed abilities with punny titles and visual representations.
1. Ball Accessibility and Play Area Restriction

Issue: The ball gets stuck in areas inaccessible to players, such as near the goal posts.
Solution: Restrict the ball’s movement to the area allocated to players, ensuring it stays within the playable bounds.
Use Cannon.js to define a playable area with static boundary bodies (e.g., invisible walls or planes) around the field’s perimeter, including the sides of the goals.
Position these boundaries just outside the visible play area, aligning with the goal post shadows to prevent the ball from entering inaccessible zones.
Configure the ball’s physics to collide with these boundaries, keeping it within reach of both players at all times.
Adjust the ball’s restitution (e.g., set to 0.7) to ensure it bounces back naturally without getting stuck.



2. Improved Kick Mechanics

Issue: The kick action isn’t working properly, and there’s no visible indication of a player kicking the ball.
Solution: Implement a realistic kick mechanic with visible feedback.
Add a leg-lifting animation for the player when the kick action is triggered (e.g., using keyframe animations or morph targets in Three.js).
Use Cannon.js to apply a force to the ball in the direction the player is facing when the kick is performed.
Ensure the kick force is strong enough to move the ball significantly (e.g., apply an impulse of 5-10 units).
Add a brief cooldown (e.g., 0.5 seconds) after each kick to prevent spamming and allow for more strategic play.



3. Random Crypto-Themed Abilities

Feature: Spawn random abilities named after crypto coins, each with a punny title, an image, and a specific boost effect.
Implementation:
Create a list of abilities with names like "Bitcoin Boost," "Ethereum Energizer," or "Dogecoin Dash."
Each ability should have a punny title and image, such as:
"Bitcoin Boost: Mine Your Way to Victory!" (increases speed, shows Bitcoin’s B logo)
"Ethereum Energizer: Smart Moves for Smart Players!" (enhances jump height, shows Ethereum’s diamond logo)
"Dogecoin Dash: To the Moon and Back!" (grants temporary invincibility, shows Dogecoin’s Shiba Inu)


Use Three.js to display the ability as a floating 3D coin or icon with the crypto logo.
When a player collects the ability (by touching it), apply the corresponding boost for a limited time (e.g., 5 seconds).
Spawn abilities randomly on the field every 20-30 seconds, ensuring they appear in accessible locations.



Testing and Debugging

Ball Accessibility: Test the new boundaries by kicking the ball towards the edges and confirming it bounces back into play.
Kick Mechanics: Verify the leg-lifting animation plays correctly and the ball moves with appropriate force and direction.
Abilities: Ensure abilities spawn correctly, display their images, can be collected, and apply the intended boosts without disrupting gameplay balance.

Additional Notes

Integrate these features smoothly with existing mechanics, avoiding performance issues.
Use simple models or sprites for ability images to maintain game performance.
Consider adding sound effects or visual cues (e.g., glow effects) when abilities are collected or activated.

Implement these enhancements step by step, testing each feature individually to ensure they work as intended and improve the overall gameplay experience.
